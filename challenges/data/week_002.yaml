      Learn to make decisions in your code!
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON: Conditional Statements
      
      ### Part 1: What Are If Statements?
      
      An `if` statement lets your program make decisions. Think of it like a fork in the road.
      
      **Basic structure:**
      ```python
      if condition:
          # Do this if condition is True
      ```
      
      **Example:**
      ```python
      age = 18
      if age >= 18:
          print("You can vote!")
      ```
      
      ### Part 2: Boolean Values (True/False)
      
      Python has two special values for yes/no questions:
      - `True` - Yes, it's true
      - `False` - No, it's false
      
      **Examples:**
      ```python
      is_raining = True
      is_sunny = False
      
      5 > 3   # True
      10 < 5  # False
      ```
      
      ### Part 3: Comparison Operators
      
      These compare values and return True or False:
      
      ```python
      ==  # Equal to
      !=  # Not equal to
      >   # Greater than
      <   # Less than
      >=  # Greater than or equal to
      <=  # Less than or equal to
      ```
      
      **Examples:**
      ```python
      5 == 5   # True
      5 == 3   # False
      10 > 5   # True
      10 < 5   # False
      age >= 18  # True if age is 18 or more
      ```
      
      ### Part 4: If/Else
      
      `else` handles the "otherwise" case:
      
      ```python
      age = 16
      if age >= 18:
          print("You can vote!")
      else:
          print("Too young to vote")
      ```
      
      ### Part 5: The Modulo Operator (%)
      
      The `%` operator gives you the REMAINDER after division:
      
      ```python
      10 % 3  # = 1 (10 divided by 3 is 3 remainder 1)
      15 % 4  # = 3 (15 divided by 4 is 3 remainder 3)
      10 % 2  # = 0 (10 divided by 2 is 5 remainder 0)
      ```
      
      **Finding even/odd numbers:**
      - Even numbers divide by 2 with NO remainder: `number % 2 == 0`
      - Odd numbers have remainder 1: `number % 2 == 1`
      
      **Examples:**
      ```python
      4 % 2   # = 0 (even)
      7 % 2   # = 1 (odd)
      10 % 2  # = 0 (even)
      ```
      
      ### Part 6: Returning True/False
      
      Functions can return boolean values:
      
      ```python
      def is_adult(age):
          if age >= 18:
              return True
          else:
              return False
      
      result = is_adult(25)  # result is True
      ```
    
    instructions: |
      Write a function that determines if a number is even or odd.
      
      Your function should:
      - Take a number as input
      - Return `True` if the number is even
      - Return `False` if the number is odd
      
      **Remember:** A number is even if dividing by 2 leaves no remainder.
      
      **Method 1: Using if/else**
      ```python
      def is_even(number):
          if number % 2 == 0:
              return True
          else:
              return False
      ```
      
      **Method 2: Shorter version (advanced)**
      ```python
      def is_even(number):
          return number % 2 == 0
      ```
      
      This works because `number % 2 == 0` already gives True or False!
      
      **Test it:**
      ```python
      is_even(4)   # True (4 % 2 = 0)
      is_even(7)   # False (7 % 2 = 1)
      is_even(0)   # True (0 % 2 = 0)
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def is_even(number):
          # Check if number % 2 equals 0
          # If yes, return True
          # If no, return False
          
          # Method 1: if/else
          # if number % 2 == 0:
          #     return True
          # else:
          #     return False
          
          # Method 2: Direct return
          # return number % 2 == 0
          
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use the modulo operator % to check for remainder when dividing by 2"
      - "Syntax: if number % 2 == 0: means 'if even'"
      - "Method 1: Use if/else to return True or False"
      - "Method 2 (advanced): You can directly return the comparison: return number % 2 == 0"
    
    tests:
      - function: is_even
        input: 4
        expected: true
      
      - function: is_even

    title: "Grade Calculator"

    time_estimate: "50-60 minutes"
    description: |
      Use multiple conditions to make more complex decisions!
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON: elif and Multiple Conditions
      
      ### Part 1: The Problem with Multiple Ifs
      
      What if you need to check multiple conditions?
      
      **Bad approach:**
      ```python
      score = 85
      if score >= 90:
          grade = "A"
      if score >= 80:
          grade = "B"  # This runs even after A!
      ```
      
      This is wrong because it checks EVERY condition!
      
      ### Part 2: Enter elif (else if)
      
      `elif` means "else, if this condition". It only checks if previous conditions were False.
      
      **Correct approach:**
      ```python
      score = 85
      if score >= 90:
          grade = "A"
      elif score >= 80:
          grade = "B"  # Only checks if score < 90
      elif score >= 70:
          grade = "C"
      else:
          grade = "F"
      ```
      
      ### Part 3: How It Flows
      
      Think of it like a waterfall:
      
      ```
      if score >= 90:        ← Check this first
          return "A"         ← If True, stop here
      elif score >= 80:      ← Only if first was False
          return "B"         ← If True, stop here
      elif score >= 70:      ← Only if above were False
          return "C"
      else:                  ← If nothing else was True
          return "F"
      ```
      
      Once one condition is True, the rest are skipped!
      
      ### Part 4: Order Matters!
      
      **WRONG ORDER:**
      ```python
      if score >= 60:     # This catches everything!
          return "D"
      elif score >= 90:   # Never reached!
          return "A"
      ```
      
      **RIGHT ORDER:**
      ```python
      if score >= 90:     # Check highest first
          return "A"
      elif score >= 60:   # Check lower values later
          return "D"
      ```
      
      **Rule:** Always check from highest to lowest (or lowest to highest consistently)!
      
      ### Part 5: Range Checking
      
      You don't need upper bounds with elif:
      
      **Don't need this:**
      ```python
      if score >= 90 and score <= 100:  # Too complex!
      ```
      
      **Do this instead:**
      ```python
      if score >= 90:      # Already know score < 100 from previous checks
      ```
    
    instructions: |
      Write a function that converts numerical scores to letter grades.
      
      The grading scale:
      - 90 or above: "A"
      - 80-89: "B"
      - 70-79: "C"
      - 60-69: "D"
      - Below 60: "F"
      
      Your function should take a score and return the appropriate letter grade.
      
      **Solution:**
      ```python
      def get_grade(score):
          if score >= 90:
              return "A"
          elif score >= 80:
              return "B"
          elif score >= 70:
              return "C"
          elif score >= 60:
              return "D"
          else:
              return "F"
      ```
      
      **Why this works:**
      - If score is 95, first condition (>= 90) is True, returns "A", done!
      - If score is 85, first is False, second (>= 80) is True, returns "B"
      - If score is 55, all conditions False, else returns "F"
      
      **Test it:**
      ```python
      get_grade(95)  # "A"
      get_grade(85)  # "B"
      get_grade(75)  # "C"
      get_grade(55)  # "F"
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def get_grade(score):
          # Check from highest to lowest
          # Start with: if score >= 90:
          #     return "A"
          # Then use elif for 80, 70, 60
          # Finally use else for F
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use if, elif, and else to check multiple conditions"
      - "Start with the highest grade first: if score >= 90:"
      - "Use elif for each additional grade: elif score >= 80:"
      - "Example structure: if... elif... elif... else..."
      - "Full example: if score >= 90: return 'A' elif score >= 80: return 'B'"
    
    tests:
      - function: get_grade
        input: 95
        expected: "A"
      
      - function: get_grade
        input: 85
        expected: "B"
      
      - function: get_grade
        input: 75
        expected: "C"

    title: "Count to Ten"

    time_estimate: "50-60 minutes"
    description: |
      Loops let you repeat code! Learn while loops by counting.
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON: While Loops
      
      ### Part 1: Why Do We Need Loops?
      
      Imagine you need to print numbers 1 to 10:
      
      **Without loops (bad):**
      ```python
      print(1)
      print(2)
      print(3)
      # ... 7 more lines!
      ```
      
      **With loops (good):**
      ```python
      i = 1
      while i <= 10:
          print(i)
          i += 1
      ```
      
      Much better!
      
      ### Part 2: How While Loops Work
      
      A while loop repeats as long as a condition is True:
      
      ```python
      while condition:
          # Do something
          # Update condition eventually!
      ```
      
      **Example:**
      ```python
      count = 1
      while count <= 3:
          print(count)
          count += 1
      ```
      
      **What happens:**
      1. Check: is count <= 3? (1 <= 3) Yes! → Print 1, count becomes 2
      2. Check: is count <= 3? (2 <= 3) Yes! → Print 2, count becomes 3
      3. Check: is count <= 3? (3 <= 3) Yes! → Print 3, count becomes 4
      4. Check: is count <= 3? (4 <= 3) No! → Stop
      
      ### Part 3: The += Operator
      
      `+=` is a shortcut for increasing a variable:
      
      ```python
      count = count + 1  # Long way
      count += 1         # Short way (same thing!)
      
      # Also works with other operators:
      score += 10    # Add 10 to score
      price -= 5     # Subtract 5 from price
      total *= 2     # Multiply total by 2
      ```
      
      ### Part 4: Building Lists with Loops
      
      You can build a list by appending to it in a loop:
      
      ```python
      numbers = []  # Start with empty list
      i = 1
      while i <= 5:
          numbers.append(i)  # Add i to the list
          i += 1
      # numbers is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      ```
      
      **The append() method:**
      ```python
      my_list = [1, 2]
      my_list.append(3)  # my_list is now [1, 2, 3]
      my_list.append(4)  # my_list is now [1, 2, 3, 4]
      ```
      
      ### Part 5: Loop Variables
      
      **Start value:**
      ```python
      i = 1  # Start at 1
      ```
      
      **Condition:**
      ```python
      while i <= 10:  # Keep going while i is 10 or less
      ```
      
      **Update:**
      ```python
      i += 1  # Increase i by 1 each time
      ```
      
      **⚠️ Warning:** Always update your loop variable or you'll have an infinite loop!
      
      **Infinite loop (BAD):**
      ```python
      i = 1
      while i <= 10:
          print(i)
          # Forgot to do i += 1, so i stays 1 forever!
      ```
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `count_to_n(n)` that returns a list of numbers from 1 to n.
      
      **Step-by-step:**
      
      1. Create an empty list: `numbers = []`
      2. Create a counter variable: `i = 1`
      3. Loop while i <= n
      4. Inside loop: append i to the list
      5. Inside loop: increase i by 1
      6. Return the list
      
      **Solution:**
      ```python
      def count_to_n(n):
          numbers = []       # Empty list
          i = 1              # Start at 1
          while i <= n:      # Loop until n
              numbers.append(i)  # Add i to list
              i += 1         # Increase i
          return numbers     # Give back the list
      ```
      
      **Test it:**
      ```python
      count_to_n(5)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      count_to_n(3)  # [1, 2, 3]
      count_to_n(1)  # [1]
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def count_to_n(n):
          # Step 1: Create empty list
          # numbers = []
          
          # Step 2: Create counter starting at 1
          # i = 1
          
          # Step 3: Loop while i <= n
          # while i <= n:
          #     Step 4: Add i to list
          #     numbers.append(i)
          #     Step 5: Increase i
          #     i += 1
          
          # Step 6: Return the list
          # return numbers
          
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Start with an empty list: numbers = []"
      - "Use a while loop: while i <= n"
      - "Append to the list: numbers.append(i)"

    topic: "Combining Conditions and Loops"
    keywords: ["loops", "conditions", "math"]
    difficulty: intermediate
    time_estimate: "60-75 minutes"
    description: |
      FizzBuzz is a classic programming challenge!
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON: Combining Multiple Concepts
      
      ### Part 1: What is FizzBuzz?
      
      FizzBuzz is a common interview question. The rules:
      - If a number is divisible by 3, say "Fizz"
      - If divisible by 5, say "Buzz"
      - If divisible by BOTH 3 and 5, say "FizzBuzz"
      - Otherwise, say the number
      
      **Examples:**
      - 3 → "Fizz" (divisible by 3)
      - 5 → "Buzz" (divisible by 5)
      - 15 → "FizzBuzz" (divisible by both!)
      - 7 → "7" (not divisible by 3 or 5)
      
      ### Part 2: Checking Divisibility
      
      Remember the modulo operator from Day 1?
      
      ```python
      15 % 3  # = 0 (divisible by 3)
      15 % 5  # = 0 (divisible by 5)
      7 % 3   # = 1 (NOT divisible by 3)
      ```
      
      **If remainder is 0, it's divisible!**
      
      ### Part 3: The "and" Operator
      
      `and` checks if BOTH conditions are True:
      
      ```python
      True and True   # = True
      True and False  # = False
      False and False # = False
      ```
      
      **Example:**
      ```python
      age = 25
      has_license = True
      
      if age >= 18 and has_license:
          print("Can drive!")
      ```
      
      Both conditions must be True!
      
      ### Part 4: Order Matters in FizzBuzz!
      
      **WRONG ORDER (doesn't work):**
      ```python
      if n % 3 == 0:
          return "Fizz"
      elif n % 5 == 0:
          return "Buzz"
      elif n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:  # Never reached!
          return "FizzBuzz"
      ```
      
      Why? If n=15, the first condition catches it and returns "Fizz"!
      
      **RIGHT ORDER:**
      ```python
      if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:  # Check BOTH first!
          return "FizzBuzz"
      elif n % 3 == 0:
          return "Fizz"
      elif n % 5 == 0:
          return "Buzz"
      else:
          return str(n)
      ```
      
      **Rule:** Check the MOST SPECIFIC condition first!
      
      ### Part 5: Converting Numbers to Strings
      
      If the number isn't divisible by 3 or 5, return it as a string:
      
      ```python
      str(7)   # "7"
      str(42)  # "42"
      str(100) # "100"
      ```
      
      Why? Because we're returning strings ("Fizz", "Buzz"), so the number should also be a string!
      
      ### Part 6: Alternative Checking Method
      
      Another way to check if divisible by both:
      
      ```python
      n % 15 == 0  # Same as: n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0
      ```
      
      Because 15 = 3 × 5!
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `fizzbuzz_single(n)` that:
      - Returns "FizzBuzz" if n is divisible by both 3 and 5
      - Returns "Fizz" if n is divisible by 3
      - Returns "Buzz" if n is divisible by 5
      - Returns the number as a string otherwise
      
      **Step-by-step:**
      
      1. Check if divisible by BOTH 3 and 5 first (most specific)
      2. Then check if divisible by 3
      3. Then check if divisible by 5
      4. Else return str(n)
      
      **Solution:**
      ```python
      def fizzbuzz_single(n):
          if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:
              return "FizzBuzz"
          elif n % 3 == 0:
              return "Fizz"
          elif n % 5 == 0:
              return "Buzz"
          else:
              return str(n)
      ```
      
      **Or using n % 15:**
      ```python
      def fizzbuzz_single(n):
          if n % 15 == 0:         # Divisible by 15 = both 3 and 5
              return "FizzBuzz"
          elif n % 3 == 0:
              return "Fizz"
          elif n % 5 == 0:
              return "Buzz"
          else:
              return str(n)
      ```
      
      **Test it:**
      ```python
      fizzbuzz_single(3)   # "Fizz"
      fizzbuzz_single(5)   # "Buzz"
      fizzbuzz_single(15)  # "FizzBuzz"
      fizzbuzz_single(7)   # "7"
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def fizzbuzz_single(n):
          # IMPORTANT: Check divisible by BOTH first!
          # if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:
          #     return "FizzBuzz"
          
          # Then check divisible by 3
          # elif n % 3 == 0:
          #     return "Fizz"
          
          # Then check divisible by 5
          # elif n % 5 == 0:
          #     return "Buzz"
          
          # Otherwise return number as string
          # else:
          #     return str(n)
          
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Check divisibility by both 3 AND 5 first!"
      - "Use the modulo operator: n % 3 == 0"
      - "Convert number to string: str(n)"
    
    tests:
      - function: fizzbuzz_single

    title: "Sum of List"
    topic: "For Loops"
    keywords: ["loops", "lists", "math"]
    difficulty: beginner
    time_estimate: "50-60 minutes"
    description: |
      For loops are perfect for going through lists!
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON: For Loops and Lists
      
      ### Part 1: What is a For Loop?
      
      A for loop goes through each item in a sequence (like a list):
      
      ```python
      fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
      for fruit in fruits:
          print(fruit)
      ```
      
      **Output:**
      ```
      apple
      banana
      cherry
      ```
      
      It automatically gets each item, one at a time!
      
      ### Part 2: For Loop vs While Loop
      
      **While loop (we know this):**
      ```python
      i = 0
      while i < len(numbers):
          print(numbers[i])
          i += 1
      ```
      
      **For loop (easier!):**
      ```python
      for number in numbers:
          print(number)
      ```
      
      For loops are simpler when working with lists!
      
      ### Part 3: The Anatomy of a For Loop
      
      ```python
      for item in collection:
          # Do something with item
      ```
      
      - `for` - keyword to start the loop
      - `item` - variable name (you choose this!)
      - `in` - keyword  
      - `collection` - the list/sequence
      - `:` - starts the loop body
      - Indented code - runs for each item
      
      **You can name the variable anything:**
      ```python
      for x in numbers:      # x is each number
      for name in names:     # name is each name
      for i in items:        # i is each item
      ```
      
      ### Part 4: Building a Sum
      
      To add all numbers in a list:
      
      ```python
      numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
      total = 0  # Start at 0
      
      for number in numbers:
          total += number  # Add each number to total
      
      # total is now 10 (1+2+3+4)
      ```
      
      **Step by step:**
      1. total = 0, number = 1 → total = 0 + 1 = 1
      2. total = 1, number = 2 → total = 1 + 2 = 3
      3. total = 3, number = 3 → total = 3 + 3 = 6
      4. total = 6, number = 4 → total = 6 + 4 = 10
      
      ### Part 5: The sum() Function (Bonus)
      
      Python has a built-in function for this!
      
      ```python
      numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
      total = sum(numbers)  # 10
      ```
      
      But for learning, it's good to understand HOW it works with a loop!
    
    instructions: |
      Write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers in a list.
      
      Your function should:
      - Take a list of numbers as input
      - Add all the numbers together
      - Return the total sum
      
      For example: [1, 2, 3, 4] should return 10
      
      **Solution:**
      ```python
      def sum_list(numbers):
          total = 0                # Start at 0
          for num in numbers:      # For each number
              total += num         # Add to total
          return total             # Return the sum
      ```
      
      **Test it:**
      ```python
      sum_list([1, 2, 3, 4])  # 10
      sum_list([10, 20, 30])  # 60
      sum_list([5])           # 5
      sum_list([])            # 0 (empty list)
      ```
      
      **Why start at 0?**
      If you start at 0, adding numbers gives the right answer.
      If you started at 1, you'd have an extra 1!
    
    starter_code: |
      def sum_list(numbers):
          # Step 1: Create variable to hold the sum, start at 0
          # total = 0
          
          # Step 2: Loop through each number
          # for num in numbers:
          #     Step 3: Add the number to total
          #     total += num
          
          # Step 4: Return the total
          # return total
          
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "You need to accumulate (build up) a running total"
      - "Start with: total = 0"
      - "Use a for loop to go through each number: for num in numbers:"
      - "Inside the loop, add each number to total: total += num"
      - "After the loop, return total"
      - "Full example: total = 0, then for num in numbers: total += num, then return total"
    
    tests:
      - function: sum_list
        input: [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
        expected: 10
      
      - function: sum_list
        input: [[10, 20, 30]]
        expected: 60

      Find the largest number in a list!
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON: Finding Maximum Values
      
      ### Part 1: The Strategy
      
      To find the biggest number, we:
      1. Assume the first number is the biggest
      2. Check each other number
      3. If we find a bigger one, remember it
      4. Return the biggest we found
      
      **Example with [3, 7, 2, 9, 1]:**
      - Start: max = 3 (first number)
      - Check 7: Is 7 > 3? Yes! → max = 7
      - Check 2: Is 2 > 7? No → max stays 7
      - Check 9: Is 9 > 7? Yes! → max = 9
      - Check 1: Is 1 > 9? No → max stays 9
      - Result: 9
      
      ### Part 2: Accessing List Elements
      
      Lists use indexes (positions starting at 0):
      
      ```python
      numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
      
      numbers[0]  # 10 (first item)
      numbers[1]  # 20 (second item)
      numbers[2]  # 30 (third item)
      numbers[3]  # 40 (fourth item)
      ```
      
      **Getting the first element:**
      ```python
      first = numbers[0]
      ```
      
      ### Part 3: The Algorithm (Step by Step)
      
      ```python
      def find_max(numbers):
          max_num = numbers[0]  # Start with first number
          
          for num in numbers:   # Check each number
              if num > max_num: # If bigger than current max
                  max_num = num # Update max
          
          return max_num        # Return the biggest
      ```
      
      ### Part 4: Comparison Operators Review
      
      ```python
      >   # Greater than
      <   # Less than
      >=  # Greater than or equal to
      <=  # Less than or equal to
      ==  # Equal to
      !=  # Not equal to
      ```
      
      **Examples:**
      ```python
      9 > 7   # True
      2 > 7   # False
      5 >= 5  # True
      ```
      
      ### Part 5: Why This Works
      
      By the end of the loop, `max_num` will have been compared
      to every number in the list. If any number is bigger, we update
      `max_num`. So `max_num` must be the biggest!
      
      ### Part 6: The max() Function (Bonus)
      
      Python has a built-in for this:
      
      ```python
      numbers = [3, 7, 2, 9, 1]
      biggest = max(numbers)  # 9
      ```
      
      But understanding HOW it works is important!
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `find_max(numbers)` that returns the largest number
      in the list.
      
      **Step-by-step:**
      
      1. Get the first number from the list (numbers[0])
      2. Store it in a variable called max_num
      3. Loop through ALL numbers in the list
      4. For each number, check if it's bigger than max_num
      5. If yes, update max_num
      6. Return max_num
      
      **Solution:**
      ```python
      def find_max(numbers):
          max_num = numbers[0]     # Start with first number
          
          for num in numbers:      # Check each number
              if num > max_num:    # If bigger
                  max_num = num    # Update max
          
          return max_num           # Return biggest
      ```
      
      **Test it:**
      ```python
      find_max([3, 7, 2, 9, 1])  # 9
      find_max([10, 5, 8])       # 10
      find_max([100])            # 100
      find_max([-5, -2, -10])    # -2
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def find_max(numbers):
          # Step 1: Start with first number as max
          # max_num = numbers[0]
          
          # Step 2: Loop through each number
          # for num in numbers:
          #     Step 3: If current number is bigger than max
          #     if num > max_num:
          #         Step 4: Update max
          #         max_num = num
          
          # Step 5: Return the maximum
          # return max_num
          
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Start with max_num = numbers[0]"
      - "Loop through and compare: if num > max_num"
      - "Update max_num if you find a larger number"
    
    tests:
      - function: find_max
        input: [[3, 7, 2, 9, 1]]
        expected: 9
      
      - function: find_max
        input: [[10, 5, 8]]
        expected: 10

      ## 🎓 LESSON REVIEW: Week 2 Recap + New Concepts
      
      ### ✅ What You Learned This Week
      
      **Day 1: If/Else**
      ```python
      if condition:
          # do this
      else:
          # do that
      ```
      
      **Day 2: elif**
      ```python
      if condition1:
          # do this
      elif condition2:
          # do this instead
      else:
          # do this if nothing else
      ```
      
      **Day 3: While Loops**
      ```python
      while condition:
          # repeat this
          # update condition!
      ```
      
      **Day 4: Boolean Logic (and/or)**
      ```python
      if x > 0 and y > 0:  # Both must be True
      if x > 0 or y > 0:   # At least one True
      ```
      
      **Day 5: For Loops**
      ```python
      for item in list:
          # do something with item
      ```
      
      **Day 6: Comparisons**
      ```python
      if num > max_num:
          max_num = num
      ```
      
      ## 🎯 Today's Challenge: Password Validation
      
      ### Part 1: String Methods You'll Need
      
      **Check if character is a digit (0-9):**
      ```python
      '5'.isdigit()    # True
      'a'.isdigit()    # False
      ```
      
      **Check if character is uppercase:**
      ```python
      'A'.isupper()    # True
      'a'.isupper()    # False
      ```
      
      **Check if character is lowercase:**
      ```python
      'a'.islower()    # True
      'A'.islower()    # False
      ```
      
      ### Part 2: Looping Through Strings
      
      You can loop through each character in a string:
      
      ```python
      word = "Hello"
      for char in word:
          print(char)
      # Prints: H, e, l, l, o
      ```
      
      ### Part 3: Using Flags (Boolean Variables)
      
      Flags are boolean variables that track if we found something:
      
      ```python
      has_number = False  # Start assuming we haven't found a number
      
      for char in password:
          if char.isdigit():
              has_number = True  # Found one!
      
      # After loop, has_number is True if we found any digit
      ```
      
      ### Part 4: Multiple Conditions Strategy
      
      For password validation, we need to check THREE things:
      1. Length >= 8
      2. Has at least one number
      3. Has at least one uppercase letter
      
      **ALL THREE must be True!**
      
      ```python
      if condition1 and condition2 and condition3:
          return True
      else:
          return False
      ```
      
      ### Part 5: Step-by-Step Algorithm
      
      1. Check length first (quick and easy)
      2. If too short, return False immediately
      3. Loop through password to check for number and uppercase
      4. Use flags to track what we've found
      5. After loop, check if we found both
      
      ### Part 6: Early Return Pattern
      
      You can return immediately when you know the answer:
      
      ```python
      if len(password) < 8:
          return False  # No need to check more!
      ```
      
      This makes code more efficient!
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `is_valid_password(password)` that returns True if
      the password meets ALL requirements:
      
      **Requirements:**
      1. At least 8 characters long
      2. Contains at least one number (0-9)
      3. Contains at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
      
      **Step-by-step:**
      
      1. Check if len(password) >= 8, if not return False
      2. Create two flags: has_number = False, has_uppercase = False
      3. Loop through each character in password
      4. If character is digit, set has_number = True
      5. If character is uppercase, set has_uppercase = True
      6. After loop, return True only if both flags are True
      
      **Solution:**
      ```python
      def is_valid_password(password):
          # Check length first
          if len(password) < 8:
              return False
          
          # Create flags
          has_number = False
          has_uppercase = False
          
          # Check each character
          for char in password:
              if char.isdigit():
                  has_number = True
              if char.isupper():
                  has_uppercase = True
          
          # Both must be True
          return has_number and has_uppercase
      ```
      
      **Test it:**
      ```python
      is_valid_password("Pass1234")        # True (has all)
      is_valid_password("short")           # False (too short)
      is_valid_password("toolongbutno")    # False (no number)
      is_valid_password("alllowercase123") # False (no uppercase)
      is_valid_password("ALLUPPERCASE123") # True (has all)
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def is_valid_password(password):
          # Step 1: Check length
          # if len(password) < 8:
          #     return False
          
          # Step 2: Create flags to track what we find
          # has_number = False
          # has_uppercase = False
          
          # Step 3: Loop through each character
          # for char in password:
          #     Step 4: Check if it's a number
          #     if char.isdigit():
          #         has_number = True
          #     Step 5: Check if it's uppercase
          #     if char.isupper():
          #         has_uppercase = True
          
          # Step 6: Return True only if we found both
          # return has_number and has_uppercase
          
          pass
