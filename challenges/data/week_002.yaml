    title: "Even or Odd?"
    topic: "If/Else Statements"
    difficulty: beginner
    time_estimate: "30-40 minutes"
    description: |
      Learn to make decisions in your code! If statements let your program
      choose different paths based on conditions.
      
      **What you'll learn:**
      - If/else statements
      - The modulo operator (%)
      - Comparison operators
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `is_even(number)` that returns True if the number
      is even, and False if it's odd.
      
      Hint: A number is even if dividing by 2 has no remainder.
      Use the modulo operator: number % 2 == 0
    
    starter_code: |
      def is_even(number):
          # Return True if even, False if odd
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use the modulo operator: % gives the remainder"
      - "number % 2 == 0 means the number is even"
      - "Use an if statement to check the condition"
    
    tests:
      - function: is_even
        input: 4
        expected: true
      
      - function: is_even
        input: 7
        expected: false
      
      - function: is_even
        input: 0
        expected: true

    starter_code: |
      def get_grade(score):
          # Return the letter grade
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use if, elif, and else"
      - "Check from highest to lowest: if score >= 90"
      - "Use elif (else if) for multiple conditions"
