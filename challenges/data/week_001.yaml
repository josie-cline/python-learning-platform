      Welcome to your Python journey! Every programmer's first program is "Hello, World!"
      
      ## 📚 What You'll Learn
      
      In this lesson, you'll learn three fundamental concepts:
      1. What the print() function does
      2. What strings are (text in programming)
      3. How to write a Python function
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON: Understanding the Basics
      
      ### Part 1: The print() Function
      
      `print()` is a built-in Python function that displays text on the screen.
      
      **How to use it:**
      ```python
      print("Hello!")
      ```
      
      When you run this, it shows: `Hello!`
      
      ### Part 2: Strings (Text)
      
      Strings are how we represent text in programming. You create a string by putting text inside quotes:
      
      ```python
      "This is a string"
      'This is also a string'
      ```
      
      Both single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) work the same way!
      
      ### Part 3: Functions
      
      A function is a named block of code that does something. Think of it like a recipe with a name.
      
      **Anatomy of a function:**
      ```python
      def function_name():
          # Code goes here
          print("This code runs when you call the function")
      ```
      
      Let's break this down:
      - `def` - This keyword means "define a function"
      - `function_name` - The name you give your function
      - `()` - Parentheses (required, we'll learn why later)
      - `:` - Colon (marks the start of the function's code)
      - Indentation (4 spaces) - Code inside the function MUST be indented
      
      **Example:**
      ```python
      def greet():
          print("Hi there!")
      ```
      
      To use (call) this function:
      ```python
      greet()  # This prints "Hi there!"
      ```
    
    instructions: |
      Now it's your turn! Create a function called `hello_world()` that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
      
      **Step-by-step:**
      1. Start with `def hello_world():`
      2. On the next line, indent 4 spaces (press Tab key)
      3. Write `print("Hello, World!")`
      
      **What it should look like:**
      ```python
      def hello_world():
          print("Hello, World!")
      ```
      
      **Important:**
      - The text must be EXACTLY "Hello, World!" (capital H, capital W)
      - Don't forget the quotes around the text
      - Don't forget to indent the print line
    
    starter_code: |
      def hello_world():
          # Step 1: Type the print() function on the line below
          # Step 2: Inside the parentheses, put quotes: ""
          # Step 3: Inside the quotes, type: Hello, World!
          # Step 4: Delete this comment and the 'pass' below
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "The print() function displays text to the screen"
      - "Text (strings) must be enclosed in quotes"
      - "Make sure your text matches exactly: 'Hello, World!'"
    
    tests:
      - function: hello_world
        description: "Prints 'Hello, World!'"
        input: null
        expected: null  # We'll check output instead

      Variables are like labeled boxes where you store information.
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON: Variables and Math
      
      ### Part 1: What Are Variables?
      
      A variable is a name that stores a value. Think of it as a labeled box.
      
      **Creating a variable:**
      ```python
      age = 25
      ```
      
      This creates a variable called `age` and stores the number `25` in it.
      
      - `age` is the variable name (the label on the box)
      - `=` means "assign" or "store"
      - `25` is the value being stored
      
      **More examples:**
      ```python
      name = "Josie"        # Store text
      score = 100           # Store a whole number
      price = 19.99         # Store a decimal number
      is_learning = True    # Store true/false
      ```
      
      ### Part 2: Types of Numbers
      
      Python has two main types of numbers:
      
      **Integers** - Whole numbers (no decimal point)
      ```python
      age = 25
      year = 2026
      score = -10
      ```
      
      **Floats** - Numbers with decimals
      ```python
      price = 19.99
      temperature = 98.6
      pi = 3.14159
      ```
      
      ### Part 3: Math Operations
      
      Python can do math just like a calculator:
      
      ```python
      5 + 3    # Addition = 8
      10 - 4   # Subtraction = 6
      3 * 4    # Multiplication = 12
      20 / 5   # Division = 4.0
      ```
      
      **Using variables in math:**
      ```python
      x = 10
      y = 5
      result = x + y  # result is now 15
      ```
      
      ### Part 4: Function Parameters and Return
      
      Yesterday you learned about functions. Today we add two new concepts:
      
      **Parameters** - Values you pass TO a function
      ```python
      def greet(name):  # 'name' is a parameter
          print(f"Hello, {name}!")
      
      greet("Josie")  # Pass "Josie" as the parameter
      ```
      
      **Return** - A value the function gives BACK
      ```python
      def add(x, y):
          result = x + y
          return result  # Give back the answer
      
      answer = add(5, 3)  # answer is now 8
      ```
      
      When you `return` a value, the function ends and gives that value back.
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function called `calculate_sum(a, b)` that:
      1. Takes two numbers as parameters (a and b)
      2. Adds them together
      3. Returns the sum
      
      **Step-by-step:**
      1. The function definition is already started: `def calculate_sum(a, b):`
      2. Inside the function, add a and b: `result = a + b`
      3. Return the result: `return result`
      
      **What it should look like:**
      ```python
      def calculate_sum(a, b):
          result = a + b
          return result
      ```
      
      **Or the shorter version:**
      ```python
      def calculate_sum(a, b):
          return a + b
      ```
      
      Both versions work the same way!
    
    starter_code: |
      def calculate_sum(a, b):
          # Step 1: Add a and b together
          # You can do: result = a + b
          # Step 2: Return the result
          # You can do: return result
          # Or combine both: return a + b
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use the + operator to add numbers"
      - "Use the return keyword to send back the result"
      - "return a + b"
    
    tests:
      - function: calculate_sum
        description: "Adding 5 + 3"
        input: [5, 3]
        expected: 8

      Strings are how we work with text in Python.
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON: String Operations
      
      ### Part 1: Creating Strings
      
      You already learned strings are text in quotes. Let's go deeper!
      
      ```python
      name = "Josie"
      message = 'Hello there!'
      long_text = "This is a longer string with spaces and punctuation!"
      ```
      
      ### Part 2: String Concatenation (Combining Strings)
      
      You can glue strings together using the `+` operator:
      
      ```python
      first = "Hello"
      second = "World"
      combined = first + second  # "HelloWorld"
      ```
      
      **Important:** Remember to add spaces!
      ```python
      greeting = "Hello" + " " + "World"  # "Hello World"
      ```
      
      ### Part 3: F-Strings (String Formatting)
      
      F-strings are an easy way to put variables inside strings.
      Put an `f` before the quotes and use `{}` for variables:
      
      ```python
      name = "Josie"
      age = 25
      message = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old"
      # Result: "My name is Josie and I am 25 years old"
      ```
      
      The `{}` gets replaced with the variable's value!
      
      **More examples:**
      ```python
      score = 100
      print(f"You scored {score} points!")  # "You scored 100 points!"
      
      x = 5
      y = 3
      print(f"{x} + {y} = {x + y}")  # "5 + 3 = 8"
      ```
      
      ### Part 4: String Functions
      
      Strings come with built-in functions:
      
      ```python
      text = "hello"
      
      text.upper()      # "HELLO"
      text.capitalize() # "Hello"
      len(text)         # 5 (length of the string)
      ```
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function called `greet_user(name)` that:
      1. Takes a person's name as a parameter
      2. Returns a greeting message: "Hello, [name]! Welcome to Python!"
      
      **Step-by-step using f-strings:**
      1. Function definition: `def greet_user(name):`
      2. Create the message: `message = f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python!"`
      3. Return it: `return message`
      
      **Or use concatenation:**
      ```python
      def greet_user(name):
          return "Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to Python!"
      ```
      
      **Examples of how it should work:**
      ```python
      greet_user("Josie")   # Returns "Hello, Josie! Welcome to Python!"
      greet_user("Alice")   # Returns "Hello, Alice! Welcome to Python!"
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def greet_user(name):
          # Option 1: Use f-string
          # return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python!"
          
          # Option 2: Use concatenation
          # return "Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to Python!"
          
          # Choose one method and delete the other option and this pass
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "You can combine strings with the + operator"
      - "Don't forget spaces: 'Hello, ' + name"
      - "Or use f-strings: f'Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python!'"
    
    tests:
      - function: greet_user
        description: "Greet Josie"
        input: "Josie"
        expected: "Hello, Josie! Welcome to Python!"
      
      - function: greet_user
        description: "Greet Alice"
        input: "Alice"
        expected: "Hello, Alice! Welcome to Python!"

    time_estimate: "50-60 minutes"
    description: |
      Let's build a simple calculator using multiple functions!
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON: Math Operations & Multiple Functions
      
      ### Part 1: The Four Basic Operations
      
      **Addition (+)**
      ```python
      5 + 3  # Equals 8
      ```
      
      **Subtraction (-)**
      ```python
      10 - 4  # Equals 6
      ```
      
      **Multiplication (*)**
      ```python
      4 * 5  # Equals 20
      ```
      
      **Division (/)**
      ```python
      10 / 2  # Equals 5.0 (notice it's a float!)
      ```
      
      ### Part 2: Creating Multiple Functions
      
      You can create as many functions as you need in one program:
      
      ```python
      def say_hello():
          print("Hello!")
      
      def say_goodbye():
          print("Goodbye!")
      
      def say_both():
          say_hello()    # Call the first function
          say_goodbye()  # Call the second function
      ```
      
      Each function does one specific thing. This makes code easier to understand!
      
      ### Part 3: Functions That Return Values
      
      Remember: `return` gives back a value that you can use elsewhere
      
      ```python
      def double(number):
          return number * 2
      
      result = double(5)  # result is now 10
      print(result)       # Prints: 10
      ```
      
      ### Part 4: Why Create Separate Functions?
      
      Instead of one giant function that does everything, we create small functions that each do ONE thing well.
      
      **Bad approach (one function does everything):**
      ```python
      def do_math(a, b, operation):
          if operation == "add":
              return a + b
          elif operation == "subtract":
              return a - b
          # This gets messy!
      ```
      
      **Good approach (separate functions):**
      ```python
      def add(a, b):
          return a + b
      
      def subtract(a, b):
          return a - b
      ```
      
      Much cleaner and easier to understand!
    
    instructions: |
      Create FOUR functions to build a calculator:
      
      1. `add(a, b)` - returns a + b
      2. `subtract(a, b)` - returns a - b
      3. `multiply(a, b)` - returns a * b
      4. `divide(a, b)` - returns a / b
      
      **Each function should:**
      - Take two parameters (a and b)
      - Do ONE math operation
      - Return the result
      
      **Example:**
      ```python
      def add(a, b):
          return a + b
      
      def subtract(a, b):
          return a - b
      
      def multiply(a, b):
          return a * b
      
      def divide(a, b):
          return a / b
      ```
      
      **Test your functions:**
      ```python
      add(10, 5)       # Should return 15
      subtract(10, 5)  # Should return 5
      multiply(4, 5)   # Should return 20
      divide(10, 2)    # Should return 5.0
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def add(a, b):
          # Return a + b
          pass
      
      def subtract(a, b):
          # Return a - b
          pass
      
      def multiply(a, b):
          # Return a * b
          pass
      
      def divide(a, b):
          # Return a / b
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Addition uses +, subtraction uses -"
      - "Multiplication uses *, division uses /"
      - "Don't forget to return the result!"
    
    tests:
      - function: add
        description: "Add 10 + 5"
        input: [10, 5]

    title: "Temperature Converter"
    topic: "Real-World Application"
    keywords: ["strings", "variables", "functions", "math"]
    difficulty: beginner
    time_estimate: "50-60 minutes"
    description: |
      Apply what you've learned by converting temperatures!
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON: Order of Operations & Formulas
      
      ### Part 1: Math Order Matters!
      
      Python follows the same math rules you learned in school (PEMDAS):
      1. **P**arentheses first
      2. **E**xponents (powers)
      3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
      4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)
      
      **Examples:**
      ```python
      5 + 3 * 2    # = 11 (not 16!)
      # Multiplication happens first: 3 * 2 = 6, then 5 + 6 = 11
      
      (5 + 3) * 2  # = 16
      # Parentheses first: 5 + 3 = 8, then 8 * 2 = 16
      ```
      
      ### Part 2: Using Formulas in Code
      
      Math formulas translate directly to Python:
      
      **Math formula:** Area = length × width  
      **Python code:**
      ```python
      area = length * width
      ```
      
      **Math formula:** Average = (a + b + c) / 3  
      **Python code:**
      ```python
      average = (a + b + c) / 3
      ```
      
      ### Part 3: Temperature Conversion Formula
      
      To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit:
      
      **Math formula:** F = (C × 9/5) + 32  
      **Python code:**
      ```python
      fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
      ```
      
      Let's break down why:
      - Multiply celsius by 9/5 (or 1.8) - this adjusts the scale
      - Add 32 - this adjusts the starting point
      
      **Test examples:**
      - 0°C = 32°F (water freezes)
      - 100°C = 212°F (water boils)
      - 25°C = 77°F (nice room temperature)
      
      ### Part 4: Verifying Your Code
      
      Always test with known values:
      
      ```python
      def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
          return (celsius * 9/5) + 32
      
      # Test it!
      print(celsius_to_fahrenheit(0))    # Should print 32.0
      print(celsius_to_fahrenheit(100))  # Should print 212.0
      ```
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)` that converts 
      Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit.
      
      **Formula:** (celsius × 9/5) + 32
      
      **Step-by-step:**
      1. Multiply celsius by 9/5
      2. Add 32 to the result
      3. Return the final value
      
      **Code it:**
      ```python
      def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
          fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
          return fahrenheit
      ```
      
      **Or the short version:**
      ```python
      def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
          return (celsius * 9/5) + 32
      ```
      
      **Test values:**
      ```python
      celsius_to_fahrenheit(0)    # Should return 32.0
      celsius_to_fahrenheit(100)  # Should return 212.0
      celsius_to_fahrenheit(25)   # Should return 77.0
      ```
      
      **Remember:** Don't forget the parentheses around `(celsius * 9/5)`!
    
    starter_code: |
      def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
          # Step 1: Multiply celsius by 9/5
          # Step 2: Add 32
          # Step 3: Return the result
          # Formula: (celsius * 9/5) + 32
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use the formula: (celsius * 9/5) + 32"
      - "Remember operator precedence: multiply before add"
      - "Test with 0°C = 32°F and 100°C = 212°F"
    
    tests:
      - function: celsius_to_fahrenheit
        description: "Convert 0°C to Fahrenheit"

      ## 🎓 LESSON: String Operations
      
      ### Part 1: String Repetition
      
      You can repeat a string by multiplying it by a number:
      
      ```python
      "Ha" * 3        # "HaHaHa"
      "Python" * 2    # "PythonPython"
      "-" * 10        # "----------"
      ```
      
      This is useful for creating patterns or dividers!
      
      ### Part 2: The len() Function
      
      `len()` tells you how many characters are in a string:
      
      ```python
      len("Hello")      # 5
      len("Python")     # 6
      len("I am 25")    # 7 (spaces count!)
      len("")           # 0 (empty string)
      ```
      
      **Using len() with variables:**
      ```python
      name = "Josie"
      length = len(name)  # 5
      print(f"{name} has {length} letters")
      ```
      
      ### Part 3: Combining Operations
      
      You can combine different string operations:
      
      ```python
      word = "Hi"
      repeated = word * 3       # "HiHiHi"
      length = len(repeated)    # 6
      
      # Or all at once:
      length = len("Hi" * 3)    # 6
      ```
      
      ### Part 4: Why This Is Useful
      
      **Creating separators:**
      ```python
      def print_title(title):
          separator = "=" * len(title)
          print(separator)
          print(title)
          print(separator)
      
      print_title("Welcome")
      # Output:
      # =======
      # Welcome
      # =======
      ```
      
      **Creating patterns:**
      ```python
      "* " * 5  # "* * * * * "
      ```
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `repeat_string(text, times)` that takes a string
      and a number, then returns the string repeated that many times.
      
      **What the function should do:**
      - Parameter 1: `text` - the string to repeat
      - Parameter 2: `times` - how many times to repeat it
      - Return: the repeated string
      
      **How to do it:**
      ```python
      def repeat_string(text, times):
          return text * times
      ```
      
      That's it! Just multiply the string by the number!
      
      **Examples:**
      ```python
      repeat_string("Ha", 3)       # Returns "HaHaHa"
      repeat_string("Python", 2)   # Returns "PythonPython"
      repeat_string("!", 5)        # Returns "!!!!!"
      ```
      
      **Try it:**
      This is a short function, but it's powerful!
    
    starter_code: |
      def repeat_string(text, times):
          # Multiply the text by times
          # Hint: text * times
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "You can multiply a string by a number: 'Hi' * 3 = 'HiHiHi'"
      - "Or use a loop (we'll learn more about loops next week!)"
    
    tests:
      - function: repeat_string
        description: "Repeat 'Ha' 3 times"
        input: ["Ha", 3]
        expected: "HaHaHa"
      
      - function: repeat_string
        description: "Repeat 'Python' 2 times"
        input: ["Python", 2]
        expected: "PythonPython"

      you've learned this week.
      
      ## 🎓 LESSON REVIEW: Week 1 Recap
      
      Let's review everything you learned this week:
      
      ### ✅ Day 1: Functions and Print
      ```python
      def say_hello():
          print("Hello!")
      ```
      
      ### ✅ Day 2: Variables and Math
      ```python
      x = 10
      y = 5
      sum = x + y  # 15
      ```
      
      ### ✅ Day 3: Strings and F-Strings
      ```python
      name = "Josie"

      ```
      
      ### ✅ Day 4: Multiple Functions
      ```python
      def add(a, b):
          return a + b
      
      def subtract(a, b):
          return a - b
      ```
      
      ### ✅ Day 5: Formulas and Order of Operations
      ```python
      result = (5 + 3) * 2  # Parentheses first!
      ```
      
      ### ✅ Day 6: String Operations
      ```python
      "Ha" * 3  # "HaHaHa"
      len("Hello")  # 5
      ```
      
      ## 🎯 Today's Challenge
      
      You'll combine:
      - Variables
      - Function parameters
      - F-strings (or concatenation)
      - Returning values
      
      ### Part 1: Understanding the Task
      
      You need to create a sentence that includes three pieces of information:
      - A person's name
      - Their age (a number)
      - The city they live in
      
      Format: "[name] is [age] years old and lives in [city]."
      
      ### Part 2: How to Build It
      
      **Option 1: Using f-strings (recommended)**
      ```python
      def personal_info(name, age, city):
          return f"{name} is {age} years old and lives in {city}."
      ```
      
      **Option 2: Using concatenation**
      ```python
      def personal_info(name, age, city):
          # Convert age to string since you're combining with text
          return name + " is " + str(age) + " years old and lives in " + city + "."
      ```
      
      **Option 3: Using .format()**
      ```python
      def personal_info(name, age, city):
          return "{} is {} years old and lives in {}.".format(name, age, city)
      ```
      
      All three work! F-strings are usually easiest.
      
      ### Part 3: Key Details
      
      **Don't forget:**
      - Spaces between words
      - The period at the end
      - Exact wording: "is" and "years old" and "lives in"
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `personal_info(name, age, city)` that returns a
      formatted string with this information.
      
      **Format:** "[name] is [age] years old and lives in [city]."
      
      **Examples:**
      ```python
      personal_info("Josie", 25, "San Francisco")
      # Returns: "Josie is 25 years old and lives in San Francisco."
      
      personal_info("Alice", 30, "New York")
      # Returns: "Alice is 30 years old and lives in New York."
      ```
      
      **Step-by-step:**
      1. Define function with three parameters: name, age, city
      2. Create the string using f-strings or concatenation
      3. Make sure spacing and punctuation are exact!
      4. Return the string
      
      **Recommended solution:**
      ```python
      def personal_info(name, age, city):
          return f"{name} is {age} years old and lives in {city}."
      ```
      
      **Tips:**
      - Test with the examples above
      - Check your spacing
      - Don't forget the period at the end!
    
    starter_code: |
      def personal_info(name, age, city):
          # Create a string with the format:
          # "[name] is [age] years old and lives in [city]."
          
          # Option 1 (easiest): Use f-string
          # return f"{name} is {age} years old and lives in {city}."
          
          # Option 2: Use concatenation
          # return name + " is " + str(age) + " years old and lives in " + city + "."
          
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use string concatenation or f-strings"
      - "f'{name} is {age} years old and lives in {city}.'"
      - "Don't forget the period at the end!"
    
    tests:
      - function: personal_info
        description: "Format personal info"
        input: ["Josie", 25, "San Francisco"]
        expected: "Josie is 25 years old and lives in San Francisco."
      
      - function: personal_info
        description: "Format different info"
        input: ["Alice", 30, "New York"]
        expected: "Alice is 30 years old and lives in New York."
