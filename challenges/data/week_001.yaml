    topic: "Your First Python Program"
    difficulty: beginner
    time_estimate: "20-30 minutes"
    description: |
      Welcome to your Python journey! Every programmer's first program is "Hello, World!"
      Today, you'll learn how to display text on the screen using Python's `print()` function.
      
      **What you'll learn:**
      - How to use the print() function
      - What strings are (text in quotes)
      - How to write and run Python code
      
      **Concepts:**
      - `print()` - displays text on the screen
      - Strings - text enclosed in quotes: "like this" or 'like this'
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function called `hello_world()` that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
      
      Example:
      ```python
      def hello_world():
          print("Hello, World!")
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def hello_world():
          # Write your code here
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "The print() function displays text to the screen"
      - "Text (strings) must be enclosed in quotes"
      - "Make sure your text matches exactly: 'Hello, World!'"
    
    tests:
      - function: hello_world
        description: "Prints 'Hello, World!'"
        input: null
        expected: null  # We'll check output instead

    topic: "Storing and Using Data"
    difficulty: beginner
    time_estimate: "30-40 minutes"
    description: |
      Variables are like labeled boxes where you store information.
      Today you'll learn how to create variables and do math with numbers!
      
      **What you'll learn:**
      - Creating variables
      - Using numbers (integers and floats)
      - Basic math operations (+, -, *, /)
      
      **Concepts:**
      - Variables store data: `name = "Josie"`
      - Integers are whole numbers: `age = 25`
      - Floats are decimal numbers: `price = 19.99`
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function called `calculate_sum(a, b)` that takes two numbers
      and returns their sum.
      
      Example:
      ```python
      calculate_sum(5, 3)  # Returns 8
      calculate_sum(10, 20)  # Returns 30
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def calculate_sum(a, b):
          # Add the two numbers and return the result
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use the + operator to add numbers"
      - "Use the return keyword to send back the result"
      - "return a + b"
    
    tests:
      - function: calculate_sum

      Strings are how we work with text in Python. You'll learn to combine strings,
      find their length, and create personalized messages.
      
      **What you'll learn:**
      - String concatenation (combining strings)
      - The len() function
      - String formatting
    
    instructions: |

      greet_user("Josie")  # Returns "Hello, Josie! Welcome to Python!"
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def greet_user(name):
          # Create and return a greeting message
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "You can combine strings with the + operator"
      - "Don't forget spaces: 'Hello, ' + name"

      subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    
    instructions: |
      Create four functions:
      - `add(a, b)` - returns a + b
      - `subtract(a, b)` - returns a - b
      - `multiply(a, b)` - returns a * b
      - `divide(a, b)` - returns a / b
    
    starter_code: |

          pass
      
      def subtract(a, b):
          pass
      
      def multiply(a, b):
          pass

    hints:
      - "Addition uses +, subtraction uses -"
      - "Multiplication uses *, division uses /"
      - "Don't forget to return the result!"
    
    tests:
      - function: add

    difficulty: beginner
    time_estimate: "40-50 minutes"
    description: |
      Apply what you've learned by converting temperatures between
      Celsius and Fahrenheit!
      
      **Formula:**
      - Fahrenheit to Celsius: (F - 32) × 5/9
      - Celsius to Fahrenheit: (C × 9/5) + 32
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)` that converts
      Celsius to Fahrenheit.
      
      Example:
      ```python
      celsius_to_fahrenheit(0)  # Returns 32.0
      celsius_to_fahrenheit(100)  # Returns 212.0
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
          # Convert celsius to fahrenheit
          # Formula: (celsius * 9/5) + 32
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use the formula: (celsius * 9/5) + 32"
      - "Remember operator precedence: multiply before add"
      - "Test with 0°C = 32°F and 100°C = 212°F"
    
    tests:
      - function: celsius_to_fahrenheit
        description: "Convert 0°C to Fahrenheit"
        input: 0
        expected: 32.0

      and repeating them!
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `repeat_string(text, times)` that repeats a string
      a specified number of times.
      
      Example:
      ```python
      repeat_string("Ha", 3)  # Returns "HaHaHa"
      repeat_string("Python", 2)  # Returns "PythonPython"
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def repeat_string(text, times):
          # Repeat the string 'times' number of times
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "You can multiply a string by a number: 'Hi' * 3 = 'HiHiHi'"
      - "Or use a loop (we'll learn more about loops next week!)"
    
    tests:
      - function: repeat_string

      formatted string with this information.
      
      Format: "[name] is [age] years old and lives in [city]."
      
      Example:
      ```python
      personal_info("Josie", 25, "San Francisco")
      # Returns "Josie is 25 years old and lives in San Francisco."
      ```
    
    starter_code: |
      def personal_info(name, age, city):
          # Create and return the formatted string
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use string concatenation or f-strings"
      - "f'{name} is {age} years old and lives in {city}.'"
      - "Don't forget the period at the end!"
    
    tests:
