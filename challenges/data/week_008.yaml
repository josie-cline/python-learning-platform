      Master Python's built-in string methods!
    
    instructions: |
      Write a function that cleans and formats a name.
      
      Your function should:
      - Take a name string (may have extra spaces, wrong case)
      - Remove leading/trailing whitespace
      - Capitalize first letter of each word
      - Return the cleaned name
      
      Example: "  john doe  " → "John Doe"
    
    starter_code: |
      def format_name(name):
          # Your code here
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use .strip() to remove leading/trailing spaces"
      - "Use .title() to capitalize first letter of each word"
      - "Chain methods: name.strip().title()"
      - "Example: return name.strip().title()"
    
    tests:
      - function: format_name
        input: "  john doe  "
        expected: "John Doe"

      Use f-strings for elegant string formatting!
    
    instructions: |
      Write a function that creates a formatted greeting.
      
      Your function should:
      - Take name and age as parameters
      - Return a formatted string: "Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."
      - Use an f-string (not .format() or %)
    
    starter_code: |
      def create_greeting(name, age):
          # Your code here using f-string
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "F-string syntax: f'text {variable} more text'"
      - "Put f before the opening quote"
      - "Variables go inside curly braces {}"
      - "Example: return f'Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.'"
    
    tests:
      - function: create_greeting
        input: ["Alice", 25]
        expected: "Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old."

      Your function should:
      - Take an email string
      - Return True if valid, False otherwise
      - Valid means: has exactly one @, has a dot after @, not empty before/after @
      - Don't use regex for now (basic string methods only)
    
    starter_code: |
      def is_valid_email(email):
          # Your code here
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Check if @ is in email: '@' in email"
      - "Count @ symbols: email.count('@') == 1"
      - "Split by @: parts = email.split('@')"
      - "Check parts[0] and parts[1] are not empty"
      - "Check if . is in parts[1]: '.' in parts[1]"
    
    tests:
      - function: is_valid_email
        input: "user@example.com"
        expected: true

      - Return a list of found phone numbers
      - Use the re module

      def find_phone_numbers(text):
          # Your code here
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Import re: import re"
      - "Pattern for digits: \\d (one digit) or \\d{3} (three digits)"
      - "Pattern for phone: \\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}"
      - "Use re.findall(pattern, text) to find all matches"
      - "Example: return re.findall(r'\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}', text)"
      - "Use r'' for raw strings to avoid escaping issues"
    
    tests:
      - function: find_phone_numbers
        input: "Call me at 555-123-4567 or 555-987-6543"
