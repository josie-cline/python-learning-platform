    title: "Dictionary Basics"
    topic: "Creating and Accessing Dictionaries"
    keywords: ["dictionaries"]
    difficulty: beginner
    time_estimate: "30-40 minutes"
    description: |
      Dictionaries store key-value pairs, like a real dictionary stores word-definition pairs!
      
      **Concepts:**
      - Creating dictionaries: {"key": "value"}
      - Accessing values: my_dict["key"]
      - Adding new keys: my_dict["new_key"] = "new_value"
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `create_user(name, age, email)` that returns a dictionary
      with these keys and their corresponding values.
      
      Example:
      create_user("Josie", 25, "josie@example.com")
      returns {"name": "Josie", "age": 25, "email": "josie@example.com"}
    
    starter_code: |
      def create_user(name, age, email):
          # Create and return a dictionary
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Use curly braces: {}"
      - "Format: {'key': value}"
      - "return {'name': name, 'age': age, 'email': email}"
    
    tests:
      - function: create_user
        input: ["Josie", 25, "josie@example.com"]
        expected: {"name": "Josie", "age": 25, "email": "josie@example.com"}

    title: "Dictionary Methods"
    topic: "get(), keys(), values()"
    keywords: ["dictionaries", "functions"]
    difficulty: beginner
    time_estimate: "40-50 minutes"
    description: |
      Learn useful dictionary methods for accessing and manipulating data!
    
    instructions: |
      Write a function that safely gets a value from a dictionary. The function should:
      - Take a dictionary, a key to look up, and an optional default value
      - Return the value if the key exists
      - Return the default value (which should be "Not found" by default) if the key doesn't exist
      - Be safer than using `dictionary[key]` which crashes if the key is missing
    
    starter_code: |
      def get_value(dictionary, key, default="Not found"):
          # Your code here
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Python dictionaries have a built-in .get() method that does exactly this!"
      - "Syntax: dictionary.get(key, default_value)"
      - "Example: person.get('age', 0) returns the age or 0 if not found"
      - "The .get() method never raises a KeyError, unlike dictionary[key]"
    
    tests:
      - function: get_value
        input: [{"name": "Josie"}, "name", "Unknown"]
        expected: "Josie"
      
      - function: get_value
        input: [{"name": "Josie"}, "age", "Unknown"]
        expected: "Unknown"

      Count how many times each word appears in a sentence!
    
    instructions: |
      Build a word frequency counter that analyzes text.
      
      Your function should:
      - Take a sentence (string) as input
      - Count how many times each word appears
      - Return a dictionary where each word is a key and its count is the value
      
      Example: "hello world hello" → {"hello": 2, "world": 1}
    
    starter_code: |
      def count_words(sentence):
          # Count words and return dictionary
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "First, split the sentence into individual words: words = sentence.split()"
      - "Create an empty dictionary to store counts: word_count = {}"
      - "Loop through each word: for word in words:"
      - "For each word, check if it's in the dictionary and increment its count"
      - "Use .get() to safely get current count: word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1"
      - "Example: If 'hello' appears, word_count['hello'] starts at 0, then becomes 1, then 2..."
    
    tests:
      - function: count_words
        input: "hello world hello"
        expected: {"hello": 2, "world": 1}

    title: "Merge Dictionaries"
    topic: "Combining Dictionaries"
    keywords: ["dictionaries", "functions"]
    difficulty: intermediate
    time_estimate: "40-50 minutes"
    description: |
      Learn to combine multiple dictionaries into one!
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)` that merges two dictionaries.
      If a key exists in both, use the value from dict2.
    
    starter_code: |
      def merge_dicts(dict1, dict2):
          # Merge and return combined dictionary
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Start with a copy of dict1"
      - "Update with dict2: result.update(dict2)"
      - "Or use: {**dict1, **dict2}"
    
    tests:
      - function: merge_dicts
        input: [{"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"b": 3, "c": 4}]
        expected: {"a": 1, "b": 3, "c": 4}

    title: "Sets Basics"
    topic: "Unique Collections"
    keywords: ["lists"]
    difficulty: beginner
    time_estimate: "30-40 minutes"
    description: |
      Sets are collections that automatically remove duplicates!
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `get_unique(items)` that returns a list of unique
      items from the input list (no duplicates).
    
    starter_code: |
      def get_unique(items):
          # Return list of unique items
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Convert to set to remove duplicates"
      - "Convert back to list"
      - "return list(set(items))"
    
    tests:
      - function: get_unique
        input: [[1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]]

    description: |
      Use mathematical set operations to find common elements!
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `common_elements(list1, list2)` that returns
      elements that appear in both lists.
    
    starter_code: |
      def common_elements(list1, list2):
          # Return common elements
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Convert both to sets"
      - "Use intersection: set1 & set2"
      - "Convert back to list"
    
    tests:
      - function: common_elements
        input: [[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]]

    difficulty: intermediate
    time_estimate: "60 minutes"
    description: |
      Build a simple phonebook using dictionaries!
    
    instructions: |
      Create a function `add_contact(phonebook, name, number)` that adds
      a contact to the phonebook dictionary and returns the updated phonebook.
      
      Example:
      add_contact({}, "Josie", "555-1234") returns {"Josie": "555-1234"}
    
    starter_code: |
      def add_contact(phonebook, name, number):
          # Add contact and return phonebook
          pass
    
    hints:
      - "Simply add to dictionary: phonebook[name] = number"
      - "Don't forget to return the phonebook"
    
    tests:
      - function: add_contact
        input: [{}, "Josie", "555-1234"]
        expected: {"Josie": "555-1234"}
