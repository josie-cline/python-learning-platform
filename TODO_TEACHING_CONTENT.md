# 📝 TODO: Complete Teaching Content

## ✅ COMPLETED

### Week 1: Python Basics - DONE
All 7 days have comprehensive teaching sections with:
- Concept explanations
- Syntax breakdowns
- Multiple examples
- Step-by-step guides

### Week 2: Control Flow - DONE
All 7 days have full lesson content teaching:
- If/else statements
- Loops (while and for)
- Boolean logic
- String methods

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### Week 3: Functions & Lists
- **Day 1:** ✅ COMPLETE (Parameters, return values)
- **Days 2-7:** ⏳ Need comprehensive teaching sections added

### Week 4: Dictionaries & Sets
- **All days:** ⏳ Need comprehensive teaching sections added

## 📅 SCHEDULE TO COMPLETE

**Target: 2 weeks from now**

Add the same level of teaching content to:
- Week 3, Days 2-7 (6 challenges)
- Week 4, Days 1-7 (7 challenges)

**Total:** 13 more challenges need teaching content

## 📋 What to Add

For each challenge, add:
1. **🎓 LESSON section** - Explain concepts from scratch
2. **Visual breakdowns** - Show code anatomy
3. **Multiple examples** - Demonstrate concepts
4. **Step-by-step instructions** - Guide practice
5. **Multiple solution approaches** - Show flexibility
6. **Common mistakes** - What to avoid

## 🎯 Current Status

**Ready to use:** Weeks 1-2 (14 challenges)  
**Need work:** Weeks 3-4, Days 2-7 (13 challenges)  
**Not started:** Weeks 5-26 (need to be created)

## 💡 Notes

Weeks 1-2 provide a solid foundation. Users can:
- Learn Python basics
- Understand control flow
- Complete 14 challenges over 2 weeks
- Build confidence before tackling more advanced topics

By the time users reach Week 3, they'll have enough foundation to work with slightly less detailed instructions, but we should still add comprehensive teaching for consistency.

## ✍️ Remember

The teaching approach should:
- Assume ZERO prior knowledge
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Show code anatomy and syntax
- Provide multiple examples
- Give step-by-step breakdowns
- Show common mistakes to avoid
